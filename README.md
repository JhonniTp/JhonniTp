👋 Hi, I’m @JhonniTp!

👀 I’m interested in web development, and currently diving deep into Flutter and Dart for frontend development.

🌱 I’m on a journey of learning and mastering Flutter to build beautiful and performant user interfaces.

💼 As a frontend developer, I enjoy crafting delightful user experiences and exploring the intersection of design and functionality.

💞️ I’m open to collaboration on frontend projects, especially those involving Flutter or any exciting web technologies.
